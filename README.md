All current available DDC, Kernel & Preset are sourced from [Viper4Android-presets](https://github.com/jadilson12/Viper4Android-presets).

But this dosen't mean they worked from the start.  
DDC & Kernel Files are the same.  
But all the Preset XML's have been reworked.

- All the Preset XML's have been renamed to their respective names for ease of use and to avoid any confusion/hassle.
- Few hundred Duplicate Preset XML's have been deleted.
- All the Preset XML's are patched to work on latest ViPER 2.7.x version.

</br>

## Patch Information:
- Added missing Tags
- Updated old Key-Value pairs in Speaker XML's
- Values of Master Limiter & Playback Gain Control set to ViPER Defaults for all XML's (Subject To Change In Future)
- Corrected/Normalized values of the following ViPER Features in XML's:
  - Field Surround
  - Differential Surround
  - Dynamic System
  - ViPER Bass
  - ViPER Clarity

  </br>

  Code used for patching [convert.py](https://github.com/syntaxticsugr/ViPER4AndroidFXRepack-Presets/blob/main/utils/convert.py).  
  Definitely not the most efficient way to do it (Waiting for your PR's), but gets the job done in under three seconds.
